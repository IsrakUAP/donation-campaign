Project features:
- Dynamic Card Categories: In my project, there is a home page that displays cards. These cards show information that is being loaded from a JSON file. Each card has a different color depending on its category. Additionally, there is a search option that allows users to filter their search results.

- Donation Tracking and Storage: My project has a page for accepting donations. When the button on the donation card is clicked, the donation details are sent to the donation page. The details are displayed in a card format and saved in the local storage for future reference.

- Interactive Pie Chart: In my project, there is a  page route "Statistics" for viewing pie charts. When users click the "Donate" button, the donated amount will be recorded and displayed as their personal donation percentage. Additionally, the percentage of the total donations will shown, ensuring that the pie chart dynamically updates as more donation cards are added to reflect changing donation ratios.
